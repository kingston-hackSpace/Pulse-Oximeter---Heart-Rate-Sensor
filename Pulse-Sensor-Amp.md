## 3D PRINT

The PulseSensor is incredibly sensitive, which is usually a good thing. But sometimes, it's a bit too sensitive. A minor movement can mess with the data readings. 

The [Stabilizer Ring](https://pulsesensor.com/products/gold-stablizer-ring) (available for 3D printing) enhances user comfort for both short-term and long-term readings. It also expands a user's freedom of movement while wearing the sensor.

## WIRING

The PulseSensor comes with a 3-cable ribbon cable terminating in a male header. The pinout is as follows:

Purple Wire = Analog Pulse Signal (Vdd/2)
Red Wire = Vdd, Power with 3V or 5V
Black Wire = Ground

## SET UP ADVICE

The PulseSensor will not work correctly without insulating the front and back of the circular circuit board with the included kit components. Some user preparation is required:

Start by insulating the front from the user's skin with the transparent Vinyl Dots.
Insulate the back from any human skin and any electronically connective material by putting velcro backing on the back of the printed circuit board.
You can wear the sensor using the included Velcro Strip on a fingertip or attach it to the included ear clip using hot glue.
